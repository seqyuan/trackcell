# TrackCell Logo

## Logo Files

- `logo.svg` - Full logo (200x200px) for main pages
- `logo_icon.svg` - Icon version (40x40px) for navigation bar and favicon

## Design Concept

The TrackCell logo combines:

1. **Cell Shape** - An elliptical cell with a nucleus, representing single-cell biology
2. **Spatial Grid** - Grid lines representing spatial transcriptomics and spatial organization
3. **Connection Lines** - Lines connecting cells, representing spatial relationships and tracking
4. **Color Scheme** - Blue tones (#2563eb, #3b82f6, #60a5fa) representing scientific precision and clarity

## Customization

To customize the logo:

1. Edit the SVG files directly (they are text-based)
2. Change colors by modifying the `fill` and `stroke` attributes
3. Adjust sizes by modifying the `width` and `height` attributes
4. Update paths in `conf.py` if you rename files

## Usage

The logo is automatically used in:
- Navigation bar (icon version)
- Browser favicon
- Homepage (full version)
